# StormyTreehouse


this is a weather app built throughout one of the teamtreehouse.com swift tutorials. 

The original app pulled data from forecast.io and populated a tableview with a weekly forecast for a set location.
I went back and added CoreLocation functionality to create a fully functioning product. It works quite well.
